Disable swapping
================

Elasticsearch recommends disabling swapping when running in production as it is bad for performance.
There are three approaches to disabling swapping:

1. Disable all swap files.

    This is the preferred option.

2. Configure swappiness.

    This option is available on Linux systems. You need to ensure that the `sysctl <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysctl>`_ value
    **vm.swappiness** is set to 1. This reduces the kernelâ€™s tendency to swap and should not lead to
    swapping under normal circumstances, while still allowing the whole system to swap in emergency conditions.

3. Enable bootstrap.mem_lock.

    This option requires to you to use **mlockall** on Linux/Unix systems, or VirtualLock on Windows, to try
    to lock the process address space into `RAM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory>`_, preventing any Elasticsearch memory from being swapped out.

In this solution I will use option 3 - :ref:`Enable bootstrap.mem_lock <elk_enable_bootstrap_mem_lock>` to disable swapping for Elasticsearch.
