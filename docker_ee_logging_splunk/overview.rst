Splunk consists of the following 3 main components:

1. `Forwarder <http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/Forwarding/Typesofforwarders>`_ - collects the logs from remote machines and forwards the data to indexers

    * Universal Forwarder - performs minimal processing and forwards the raw data
    * Heavy Forwarder - performs parsing and indexing at the source and forwards the processed data

2. `Indexer <http://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Indexer>`_ - parses and indexes the log data, and stores it for analysis and searching
3. `Search Head <https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Searchhead>`_ - graphical user interface for searching and displaying the log data

Optional components:

* `Monitoring Console <https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/DMC/DMCoverview>`_ - lets you view detailed topology and performance information about your Splunk Enterprise deployment.
