Prerequisites
=============

jq command
----------

Some of the commands in this Solution Brief use the **jq** command to format and display json output.  If the **jq** command is not installed you can download and install it from here: https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/Installation.

Elastic license
---------------

In order to secure the Elastic stack using the Elastic X-Pack package included with the Elastic docker images, you will need to obtain a license other than the Basic Free License.
The Basic Free license does not even allow you to secure the Kibana console. Anyone will be able to login without being prompted for credentials.

Go to `Elastic Subscriptions <https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions>`_ for more details.
